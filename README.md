# A basic app fullstack with flask, vuejs and docker !

This app is fullstack application with docker compose. Back-end is powered by flask python micro framework and the front-end is powered by vueJS javascript framework.

Make sure you have docker installed on your system.

## Launch application

> docker-compose up -d

## No volume set

I was not able to integrate the volume for a continuous deployment.
I got this error: ***Named volume "front/app:/app:rw" is used in service "front" but no declaration was found in the volumes section.***

If you have a solution you can doing a merge request !
