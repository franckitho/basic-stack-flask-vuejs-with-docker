# A basic app fullstack with flask, vuejs-with and docker !

This app is fullstack application with docker compose. Backed is powered by flask python micro framework and the frontend is powered by vueJS javascript framework.

Make sure you have docker installed on your system.

## Launch application

> docker-compose up -d

## No volume set

I was not able to integrate the volume for a continuous deployment.
I got this error: ***Named volume "front/app:/app:rw" is used in service "front" but no declaration was found in the volumes section.***

If you have a solution you can doing a merge request !
